![Good README.md Generator](./Assets/img/EAT-DA-BURGER-GIF.gif)

## Installation

Download this package, open your command line interface and run npm install. This should install the following dependencies aswell: express, path, and moment. If for some reason, you need to install the dependencies individually run npm install "dependency_name".

Next run the following command to start the app: "node index.js"

```bash
npm install 
```

```bash
npm install express
```

## Usage 

The application will deploy a employee tracker application in a CLI application. Begin by typing "npm start". 

```bash
npm start 
```

Next, press the down or up arrow keys to scroll to choices with the corresponding action of your choice and press enter. Follow the prompt instructions to enter in details about your department, role, or employee. When ready to input your information, press ENTER.

Note: When updating role and you are prompted for a salary value, don't use the "$", just the number value. Also, when viewing all employees or adding a new employee, the "null" manager stands for an employee having no manager. Furthermore, currently there are only two managers, Chris Roque and Lorrey Talbet.
